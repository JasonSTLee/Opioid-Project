## The analysis will be done on Postgresql and visualized on Tableau. My goal is to showcase and spread awareness of the disease that has plagued our nation and in doing so, further my SQL, Tableau and data analysis learnings.

#### I originally used this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population) to find the populations of each state but the year's are inaccurate since displayed are years: 2020, 2010, and 2000 which I used for Fall, Peak and Rise years respectively. In order to have a more accurate population count, I used Census Bureau's API to get the population for years: 2019, 2014, and 2010 as my Fall, Peak and Rise years respectively. The code for that can be found in census.ipynb.
